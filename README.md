# Memory Game Cards

**Memory game Cards** is a game that I created with the help of **Udacity**. It is a project that I must complete as part of the Google Udacity FEND Nanodegree.
I decided to download the starter code that Udacity provided. This consisted of a HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file with one function in it (the shuffle function).
I have built most of the JavaScript functionality. I have made the page responsive (with media queries) to different size screens.

## Instructions

There are 8 pairs of matching cards, initially turned "face down". The user should click on one of these to turn it over. They should then click on another "face down" card. If the cards match, their colour will change from <span style="color: #02b3e4">#02b3e4</span> to <span style="color: #02ccba">#02ccba</span>. If the cards do not match, they will briefly turn <span style="color: red">red</span> - and then they will turn back to "face down".

Here is the live version.
