# Memory Game Cards

**Memory game Cards** is a game that I created with the help of **Udacity**. It is a project that I must complete as part of the Google Udacity FEND Nanodegree. 
Rather than start from scratch, I decided to download the starter code that Udacity provided.
I have built most of the JavaScript functionality

Here is the live version.
